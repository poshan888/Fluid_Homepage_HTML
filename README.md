### How I approached: 
#### I find this project suitable and comfortable to develop. All the sections have their certain dimension and properties to be used for that, firstly I liked the documentation which we had provided that how to make this proper step by step guidance that makes easier to understand the design and making it visually appealing. I had faced issues while working with bootstrap sticky-top which we had used for header other then that for making of real life section using Grid Property for the output.
### Pending: 
* Responsive for all screens
* Animations on Scroll
